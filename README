  vsftpd - Very Secure FTP Daemon

  vsftpd is the Very Secure File Transfer Protocol Daemon. The server can
  be launched via a “super-server” such as inetd(8) or xinetd(8).  Alterna-
  tively, vsftpd can be launched in standalone mode, in which case vsftpd
  itself will listen on the network. This latter mode is easier to use, and
  recommended. It is activated by setting listen=YES in
  /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.  Direct execution of the vsftpd binary will then
  launch the FTP service ready for immediate client connections.
