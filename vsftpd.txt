vsftpd - Very Secure FTP Daemon
           or
         Very Secure File Transport Protocol Daemon


DESCRIPTION
     vsftpd is the Very Secure File Transfer Protocol Daemon. The server can
     be launched via a “super-server” such as inetd(8) or xinetd(8).  Alterna-
     tively, vsftpd can be launched in standalone mode, in which case vsftpd
     itself will listen on the network. This latter mode is easier to use, and
     recommended. It is activated by setting listen=YES in
     /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.  Direct execution of the vsftpd binary will then
     launch the FTP service ready for immediate client connections.

OPTIONS
     An optional [configuration file] may be given on the command line. This
     configuration file has to be owned by root. The default configuration
     file is /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.

Configuration:
  /etc/vsftpd/
    chroot_list
    ftpusers
    user_list
    vsftpd.conf
    vsftpd_conf_migrate.sh


Does vsftpd support plain FTP?
==============================
In spite of its name it supports FTP.  The name VSFTPD stands for
"Very Secure File Transport Protocol Daemon".

abstract
--------
The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used as one of the most common
means of copying files between computers over the Internet.  Most
web based download sites use the built in FTP capabilities of web
browsers and therefore most server oriented operating systems
usually include an FTP server application as part of the software
suite. Linux is no exception.  With this page I will show how to
convert a DebianGNU/Linux box into an FTP server using the vsftpd
(Very Secure FTP Daemon) package which is included with the
standard Debian distribution i.e. no need to compile anything
ourselves which saves time and makes things work even for the
inexperienced users.

There are many tutorials, such as this one titled: How To
Configure vsftpd to Use SSL/TLS on an Ubuntu VPS that show how
to setup regular FTP service using vsftpd. The first section
describes the steps.

After editing the config file: sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf:

anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
Then add a ftp user:

$ sudo adduser ftpuser
Then create their home directory:

$ sudo chown root:root /home/ftpuser
And create directories for them to upload/download to within:

$ sudo mkdir /home/ftpuser/files
$ sudo chown ftpuser:ftpuser /home/ftpuser/files
